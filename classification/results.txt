Summary: low sodium wild ride
Text:  Wild Ride is some of the lowest sodium beef jerky I've found.  At least for Hoppin' Hickory and Gallopin' Pepper flavors.  Plus, they provide me with a way to get more of a whole food in my protein requirements.  Nice job, Wild Ride.<br /><br />Why only 4 stars?  The flavor could be the tiniest bit better.  The price could be a bit lower.  Reduce the sodium content of the other flavors, and the line would be more well-rounded for me.

The pretzel pieces are mostly smallish, crunchy bites.

Summary: Excellent Matcha for Beginners!
Text:  There are so many good things to say about this matcha as well as this company.  Let's start with how awesome Red Leaf Tea is.<br /><br />The customer service is prompt and friendly.  They listen to your suggestions and opinions and take action to please their customers.  It's a sad world when decent customer service is a novelty, but Red Leaf Tea brings some joy back into a bleak world with their courtesy.  Thank you, Red Leaf Tea!<br /><br />Now, this matcha...it's great for beginners!  The price is perfect and you get a good amount of tea so you can experiment with  how you like to drink it.  The basic flavors here are sweet, green and minerally.  THe texture is pretty smooth with only a hint of a powdery texture.  It's a pleasing beverage hot, prepared in the traditional way.  Yes, the quality isn't the best, but it is definitely a good introduction.  It is not bitter at all and completely inoffensive.  I used to be scared of preparing my own matcha because the one time I did it before Red Leaf, it was with a horrible matcha that was extremely bitter.  Now I make myself matcha drinks all the time!<br /><br />After trying this tea the traditional way to fully appreciate the flavors you're working with, you can use the powder to add flavor and healthiness to pretty much anything!  Like the Starbucks green tea latte?  Now you can make your own at a fraction of the cost!  Breakfast smoothie need a healthy caffeine kick?  BAM! Starter Matcha to the rescue!  Want some green tea cookies to go with your green tea latte?  You know where I'm going with this.  :)<br /><br />My favorite way to have this matcha right now is to add it to my Almond milk, banana smoothie.  It was also awesome in my amaretti cookies.  :)<br /><br />Conclusion?  Highly recommended!

Summary: Potassium Pick-me-Up
Text:  I've been using CocoHydro, Original, for 2 months now. I remember finding their website and inquiring about the nutritional information for this product before it was even sold on the market. The company has been very considerate and prompt to answer all my emails and questions! I suffer chronic hypokalemia (low potassium) in conjunction with a lifelong history of eating disorders and health problems in relation to them. I need all the added nutrients I can get, including weekly nutrient IV therapy due to radical defeciences and digestion/absorption problems. I have been using Cocohydro as a supplement everyday and love it. It's a great way to boost electrolytes. I add it to my food and beverages, even fresh coconut water that I drink daily... every little bit helps. I was expecting more of a coconut taste and was surprised to find it rather bland but my primary purpose of usage is supplementation so it doesn't bother me that it's plain. The amount of potassium in 1 single serving literally almost compares to the amount of potassium in a serving of fresh coconut water. I can double the fun and add both together for a super boost! I have no interest in the flavored varities but I'm sure they offer more taste than the original - for those who feel they need added flavor. I order through subscribe and save and get a discount on my purchases! I get 2 bags sent to me every month so I don't have to worry about running out or ordering again. PS. Great for car or travel, carry an extra in your car or bring one with you - you never know when you will need an extra boost!

Summary: Try this coffee if you like Vanilla flavoring
Text:  This is just a delightful coffee.  My husband and I are fans of flavored coffee, particularly vanilla and hazelnut.  Even though this is already ground, there is a distinct vanilla aroma/flavor that lasts and is not overpowering.  A secondary concern is that I drink about five cups a day, so I'm looking for any acidic reaction; there is none.  The coffee strength is medium, perfect for drinking in the morning and all day.  I always keep my coffee, especially ground, in the freezer for freshness.  The expiration date is clearly marked on the bottom of the package; mine are for June 29, 2011, but the four packages will not last that long.  Do the math on the cost; my purchase worked about to about $6.60 per pound, including super saver shipping, which is most reasonable these days.  I recommend this coffee.

Text:  If you're looking for great value and great taste then this product is for you. I was skeptical about artisan salts and sea salts being different than regular salt until I accidentally ordered a case of sea salt from Portugal from our Co-op. Artisan salts and sea salts add flavor and zing to sea food, grilled foods and vegetables. I've never looked back and only use these special kinds of salts on everything. Be advised, though, if you put pink salt on something, it will turn that something slightly pink.<br /><br />Try this salt and then try salt from Hawaii, Portugal, France, prussian blue from Germany, salt from Japan, Mexico, etc ... You will be surprised at the diversity in taste.

Great time to get into my jammies and curl up with a cup of Stash Tea, put on my favorite singer (BM) and write Amazon reviews for you fine folks out there!<br /><br />I have been a tea drinker all my life, and Stash is great tea.  This flavor is wonderful and one of my old favorites.  Now they have plenty new and creative flavors but this still remains wonderful, simple, and basic, with a nice smooth peach flavoring.  Stash is stronger than your basic tea bags (Lipton, etc.) so depending on how strong you like your tea, you might only need one bag for a 24 oz cup like I do.  I drink it black with natural unbleached sugar or agave nectar (sweetener made from cactus juice and available in many food stores in the organic section.)<br /><br />Great flavor and worth the price difference.

Summary: Not the original Knorr Pesto Sauce mix-this is loaded with artificial ingredients.
Text:  I bought a huge case of these knorr pesto sauces because my fiancee and I used to eat them a year ago all the time and back then they were delicious.  But then we moved and my local grocery store did not carry the knorr pasta sauces.  However when they arrived and I opened the package I was in for a big disappointment.  One thing I used to love about knorr was they used real ingredients-real parmesan and romano cheeses. Apparently not any more.  Now this sauce mix is completely artificial-corn starch and preservatives and artificial flavors-blech!  It doesn't taste anywhere near as good as the original.<br /><br />However I give it three stars because it's still tastes better than a lot of the sauces in the store and at least you can use olive oil in your sauce instead of the vegetable oil based sauces in the store.  Knorr should be ashamed for ruining a great product.  If they had stuck to the original recipe, I'd have given it five stars.  I know they are saving money by using artificial ingredients but the cost is too high as this affects the taste and our health.  I wouldn't have bought 24 packs if I had known the recipe had changed.  I hope they will reconsider the change and put real ingredients back in this product.  Here are the ingredients since Amazon doesn't list them:<br /><br />Maltodextrin, corn starch, wheat flower, salt, whey (milk), monosodium glutamate,spinach, garlic powder, basil, sugar, natural flavor (soy), onion powder, spice

But I have to say I was disappointed with this product. Don't be fooled by the photo on the box, people! The "blue bran" name is misleading--I found approximately 3 freeze-dried blueberry 'chips' in my batter. You will definitely need to add your own fresh or frozen blueberries to the mix, otherwise you'll just have plain old bran muffins.<br /><br />Even after I added fresh blueberries to my batter, the end product was not very good--it was gooey and bland, with a weird after-taste.  My family usually inhales the Vitalicious products, but these are still in the freezer.<br /><br />I have two boxes of the mix left, so I'm going to try adding chunks of apple to the next batch, along with some cinnamon to give it some flavor, and see if I get a better result.  Bottom line: Skip these and go for the Vitalicious Deep Chocolate mix.

The cookies have an awful fake chocolate flavor, and the they are chalky tasting and dry.  There was nothing gooey about the center of the cookie.  It was more of the same dry, grainy taste as the "cookie" part.  And at 150 calories for 2 cookies (which are less than 2 inches in diameter) they are not worth eating.  They have 7 grams of fat in two small cookies, of which 3.5 is saturated fat, coming from coconut and palm oils.<br /><br />I will however, give credit to Nabisco for two things.  They did load the cookies with a lot of white chocolate chips so they certainly did not skimp on that ingredient, and the resealable package is a great idea.  The opening for the package pulls apart from the top, and there is a sticky type substance that hold the wrapper in place once you reseal it.  I would not consider it air tight, but it certainly makes a good seal for the package.  I can not recommend these cookies based on the taste, texture, and high caloric intake per small serving size.  I will not be buying these cookies again.

Summary: Fantastic fun soda!
Text:  Ramune has to be one of the coolest and most unique soft drinks that I have ever seen. My kids had been dying to try this stuff ever since they had come across it on J-Box, the popular Japanese import webshop. Ramune is incredibly popular in it's native Japan, and now it looks like the fun is beginning to spread here in the States.<br /><br />To open a bottle of Ramune, you have to remove the top, pop out this little plastic plunger from it's casing, and then use the plunger to pop out a marble that seals the neck of the bottle. The neck of the bottle has two indentions that will hold the marble when you tip the bottle back to drink from it, keeping the neck of the bottle clear. Hold the bottle the wrong way, and the marble will clog things up. You can avoid carbonated overflow when opening by pressing gently on the plunger until it depresses the marble; knock it down with force and you're sure to get a fountain of spray.<br /><br />The melon flavor reviewed here has a very unique taste. Think honeydew more than watermelon, sweet and light with that distinctive Ramune lemon-lime backbone flavor holding everything together. Truly a treat.<br /><br />This is a way fun product that kids (and most adults) will have a blast with. It's a smaller portion (8 ounces) than what we're used to here in the US, but that actually works out for us as we're trying to limit the amount of soda that our kids consume. Ramune works great as an occasional soda treat and the fun factor alone keeps us coming back for more. Ramune is easy to find at just about any Asian market, but for those who don't have easy access to one, ordering here on Amazon would be recommended.<br /><br />Also, for the safety conscious, I can attest that these drinks are very safe. We've never had a problem with the marble, and I can't find any reports on the internet that would indicate any safety concerns with this drink. It's not a choking hazard, in other words. Ramune means 'carbonated' in Japanese, and I can highly recommend this wonderful and very different drink.

I've tried a ton of different brands, and so far, this is the only one that doesn't give me horrible cramps. I suspect it's because most other sugar-free gums contain maltitol, but anyway, Stride's the only kind of gum I'll buy, particularly this kind.<br /><br />As some reviewers have pointed out, if you order this on here either via Subscribe & Save or as a single order, you'll still get the Stride 2.0 version, not the original Sweet Peppermint (RIP, and they really should change the photo). It's not as good as the original was, but it's still a pretty decent flavour and just as long-lasting. The sweetness does sort of wear off, after a while, and it becomes a bit bitter (but if you're like me and like bitter stuff, it's all for the better!).

Summary: Do your own scattered, covered, and chunked!
Text:  If you are a fan of a certain chain of restaurant's hashbrowns these are the ticket!  Very close results, and very easy and fast to cook.  A fair warning.. don't need any salt on these when cooking.

Summary: Miracle-grow for cats!
Text:  We originally got this for our Bengals, it was what the breeder recommended.  Then, we found two kittens only a day old on the street and adopted them.<br /><br />After they were weaned they took to this stuff like gangbusters.  Now, they are both 20 plus pound monster kitties.  Never sick a day in their lives, glossy coats, full of energy.<br /><br />Picky cats love Felidae, it is full of healthy ingredients.  Obviously, however, it's not the best food for cat weight control! Now the boys are on a "light" cat food, and they aren't quite as happy.<br /><br />So, I suggest this for Bengals or cats who need to put on a few pounds.
